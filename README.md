# Welcome to LeSSBASH!

Learning Some Sweet BASH is my repository for any scripts I toss together while learning BASH.

The name is probably the fanciest thing in here.

I will probably come back at the end of the course I am currently doing and re-organize all the code so that it can be sorted and navigated more clearly.
